![PlasmaSolution-logo](https://github.com/SebastianDahle/PlasmaSolution/blob/master/PlasmaSolution.jpg "PlasmaSolution-logo")
The project *PlasmaSolution* is a Marie Sklodowoska Curie Actions - Individual Fellowship by the European Commission that aims to implement non-thermal plasma technology at the Department of Wood Science and Technology, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. Further goal of the project is the development and testing of plasma-cured coatings for wood protection as an innovative new appraoch in coatings deposition.

## WARNING

**!! Dealing with plasma involves using high voltages. Please make sure you are familiar with all safety instructions and necessary practices!**
